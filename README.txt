== Description ==

This plugin allows you to import your NFT collection from Hic et Nunc (HEN) to your WordPress website. A NFT custom post type is registered where all NFTs, and metadata, will be stored. 

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'hen' directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the HEN menu and save your Tezos Wallet address
4. Visit the HEN -> Import NFTs submenu to import all NFTs under your account

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I only import my NFT collection? =

No, you can import any collection if you have the Tezos Wallet address. 

= What information is imported? =

Currently the plugin imports the NFT name, description, NFT file, creator address, token ID, and balance.

= What if I want to remove NFTs from my website? =

The plugin features a DELETE option to remove any NFT entries this plugin has created completely from WordPress.

= Will deleting my imported NFT entries remove content from my website? =

This plugin can only delete NFT custom post type entries that it creates. All of your existing content will be untouched.
