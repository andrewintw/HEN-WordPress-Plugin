# HEN WordPress Plugin

This WordPress plugin allows you to import your NFT collection from Hic et Nunc (HEN) to your WordPress website. A NFT custom post type is registered where all NFTs, and metadata, will be stored. 

## Features

* Connect to your Tezos Wallet
* Import all NFT collectibles into a new NFT custom post type registered in WordPress
* Uses Composer to handle linting and code quality tools before committing it to a repository.
* Uses a strict file organization scheme to make sure the assets are easily maintainable.

## Usage

The WordPress Widget Boilerplate is ready to activate as-is (and it includes a sample widget with a title, content, and checkbox).

1. Upload all files to a 'hen' directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to the HEN menu and save your Tezos Wallet address
4. Visit the HEN -> Import NFTs submenu to import all NFTs under your account

All NFTs imported can be deleted using this plugin.
